Dear ,

I am writing you about the Urban - Rainwater data collaboration. We were reviewing the data in order to proceed with the analysis and we relised that some entries are missing (i.e. from variables: fieldsample_barcode, sample_type, sampling_date, latitude, longitude, habitat_type, habitat_typenumber, sitename, mfd_sampletype, mfd_areatype, mfd_hab1, mfd_hab2 and mfd_hab3).
Could you please fill in the missing entires (if you are able to retrieve them) in the attached file "table_to_fill.csv"?
The complete table should look like the extract "example_table.csv"

Best regards,
