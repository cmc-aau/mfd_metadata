Dear Tobias and Rasmus,

I am writing you about the Biowide - Original data collaboration. We were reviewing the data in order to proceed with the analysis and we realised that some entries are missing (i.e. from variables: fieldsample_barcode, sample_type, sampling_date, latitude, longitude, habitat_type, habitat_typenumber, sitename, mfd_sampletype, mfd_areatype, mfd_hab1, mfd_hab2 and mfd_hab3).

Could you please fill in the missing entires (if you are able to retrieve them) in the attached file "table_to_fill.xlsx"? The complete table should look like the extract "example_table.xlsx".
In the "table_to_fill.xlsx" the first sheet (called variables) contains the data whilst the second one (called description) explains each variable and what kind of input is needed from your side. The "variables" sheet includes the missing entries for which your input is needed (highlighted in green), as well as the missing entries that will be automatically filled by us (highlighted in orange) given your input on the variable "habitat_typenumber". We included the ontology file ("2022-11-28_mfd-habitat-ontology.xlsx") to help in choosing the most descriptive habitat_typenumber.

Considering your previously provided data, we were wondering whether the sites corresponing to "plantation forests" can be assigned to habitat_typenmubers within the 9xxx categories ("Forests"), to fit with the rest of the data. If this is the case, could you please fill the most specific habitat_typenumber in the highlighted cells?

In the file you sent us ("FinalVægteTilUniquenessUdregning.xlsx"), we have a few questions. For the cases of sitenames "Knagerne" and "Urskoven" should we choose 9110 or 9120? For the cases where we have "pilekrat, §3mose" and "§3 mose, rørsump/højstaude" can we please get the corresponding most specific habitat_typenumber?
For the samples marked with "Agriculture" as "habitat_type", do you have information on the crop type or can you chose from the attached ontology file?

Best regards,
Per Halkjær Nielsen
